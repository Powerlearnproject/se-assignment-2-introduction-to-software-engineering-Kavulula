Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is an aspect of computer science dealing in design, development testing, implimentation and maintenance of computer software.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Refers to a method of clearly defined software development criteria.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Requirement analysis- this is when the unique problem a software is meant to solve is identified. Requires input from all involved stakeholders.
Planning Phase- Where the resources, material and financial are determined for the deveelopment phase to begin.
Design- this is where the software specs are turned in to a design specification.
Build- Where the actual development takes place through programming 
Code Test- the testing phase of the development begins and any errors or amendments to the software are carried out.
Deplyoment- Actual user roll-out and use in a production environment.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
These are two types of project management work flows
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile Model-Agile
 This model in software development refers to methodologies centered around the idea of iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.

Waterfall methodology
is a step-by-step approach to software development that focuses on sequentially progressing through each stage and phase of the development process.  Aptly named so because each phase of the project cascades in to the next.
The key differences in the two models are;
Agile is best suited for projects that require flexibility and constant changes and where customer feedback is critical such as in software development.
The Agile model highlights the collaboration between the development team and the stakeholders. This collaboration helps to ensure that the project meets the needs of the stakeholders and that everyone is on the same page.
Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined stages and straightforward, linear requirements.
Since the Waterfall model follows a sequential process, predicting the projectâ€™s outcome is easier. This makes estimating the time and resources required for each project phase easier.


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Refers to the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process.
It is a five sep process including
Feasibility Study
Requirements elicitation
Requirements specification
Requirements for verification and validation
Requirements management
Good requirements management helps clearly define project goals, avoid errors and meet expectations.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design.
Modularity in computing and programming refers to dividing a system into separate modules or components. Each module handles a specific functionality and operates independently.

How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
By breaking down the software into independent modules, you can more easily adapt, extend, or replace parts of the system without affecting others.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit Testing is testing individual components to see if they work. Developers use tools like JUnit and PyTest for this. Integration Testing is testing combined components. Developers or specialized testers can do this with tools like TestNG and Apache Camel. System Testing is testing the entire system to see if it meets all the requirements. QA teams do this level of testing with tools like Selenium and LoadRunner. Acceptance Testing is the final test before the software goes live to see if it meets business requirements. End-users or customers do this with tools like Cucumber and FitNesse. Why Testing Testing ensures quality by giving high quality products. It finds bugs early, saves time and money. It reduces risk by preventing big failures. Testing ensures compliance to standards and regulations, improves user satisfaction and validates real world performance. In short, testing is for reliable software.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code. 
The version control systems are impotant because they 
reduce possibilities of errors and conflicts meanwhile project development through traceability to every small change
Helps in recovery in case of any disaster or contingent situation
For each different contributor to the project, a different working copy is maintained and not merged to the main file unless the working copy is validated.

Examples of version control systems
Git
Mercurial
AzureDevOps
AWSVersion Comitt

Features of Version Control Systems
Branching
Backup
Collaboration
tracking changes
Productivity.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Role of a Software Project Manager
 A project manager is in charge of the entire project. He/she creates a scope, budget and timeline of the completion of the project.
 Software Project Manager

A software project manager is responsible for getting software projects done on time, on budget and to quality.

Key Tasks -

Planning and Scheduling:

Creating project plans and schedules.

Team Leadership: Leading the team, assigning tasks and making sure everyone is on the same page.

Stakeholder Communication: Keeping everyone informed - clients to team members and dealing with any issues that arise.

Biggest Challenges -

Scope Creep:

Dealing with changes to the project scope and tasks -

Time: Keeping to the schedule.

Resources: Working with what you have.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software Maintenance-is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs.
Corrective software maintenance- addresses the errors and faults within software applications that could impact various parts of your software, including the design, logic, and code.
Adaptive software maintenance- Refers to software maintenance that seeks to adapt the software to the changing environmnet.
Perfective software maintenance-this is when software is maintained to provide the changes users want.
Preventive Maintenance-refers to adaptations to software maintenance to prevent deteroriation as it adapts and improves.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:


What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical Issues are such as;
Algorithnic bias
unethical data collection
weak security

Ethical Considerations for software engineering are such as;
Transparency
Fairness
Privacy 
Security
Accountability

Engineers can adhere to ethical practices by doing the following;
Being honest and avoiding false advertisements
being accountable
be proactive, through assessing the technology under development to safeguard against future potential abuse.
